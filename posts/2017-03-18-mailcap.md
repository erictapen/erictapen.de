title: Configuring mailcap by regex
---

This blogpost is propably only useful to people with no to little knowledge of regex. In it's center stands a big shell command which I will explain most of the post.

`~/.mailcap` is a file which describes how programs should handle files with a certain MIME-type. It's essentially a list of all handled MIME-types, semicolon seperated by the according command for opening the file. `%s` stands for the filename:

```
application/pdf; evince %s;
```

My mailprogram depends on `~/.mailcap` for opening attachments. At first, I had a hard time repeatingly discovering a new MIME-type, handling it in `.mailcap` and running into another unhandled one again, until I decided to solve the problem once for ever by using grep.

My mails are stored in a directory called `~/Mail/`, but for this tutorial it is only important to have it in plaintext somewhere. By finding all the MIME-types mentioned in my mail, I generated the most complete mailcap file I can think of. The shell command for doing it is the following:

```
grep -Ehor '\b((?:application|audio|example|font|image|'\
'message|model|multipart|text|video|chemical)/[a-z-]+?)\b' \
Mail/ | sort -u > ~/.mailcap
```

## Command explained

The command above greps through all mail for MIME-types, sorts them and makes the list consist only of unique entries and writes it into `.mailcap`. Please note that that command will overwrite your existing `.mailcap` file. Find the command tree below.

* `grep` command for searching in files.
    * `-E` use more powerful "extended regular expressions".
    * `-h` don't display the name of the matching file.
    * `-o` only matches, don't show the rest of the matching line.
    * `-r` recursive, grep goes through files and subdirectories in the dir. Is not necessecary if you have a single file with your mail.
    * long regex, is explained below.
    * `Mail/` my mail directory
* `|` a "pipe", sends the result of the `grep` command into the following `sort` command. Try calling only the part before the pipe in order to understand it's use.
* `sort` sorts text
    * `-u` makes the entries of the sorted list unique
* `>` takes the result of the `sort` command and writes it into the following file. Again, try to run only the beginning of the command until this symbol to understand it's use.
* `~/` short for my home directory
* `.mailcap` mailcap file

## Regex explained

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type), MIME-types start with a prefix describing the category, followed by a slash and ended with the exact type (consisting only of the letters `a-z` and `-`). The prefix must be one of the following:

* `application`
* `audio`
* `example` 
* `font` 
* `image` 
* `message` 
* `model` 
* `multipart` 
* `text` 
* `video` 
* `chemical` (unofficial)

The shell command uses the following regex, which matches against this definition. Again, it is stretched over two lines:
```
\b((?:application|audio|example|font|image|
message|model|multipart|text|video|chemical)/[a-z]+?)\b
```

What follows is kind of the abstract syntax tree of the regex. Please note, that it is an extended regular expression.

* `\b` word boundary, marks the beginning/end of a word.
* `(` start a first group
    * `(` start a second group...
        * `?:` ...but do not remember the second group
        * `application` match for the exact word 
        * `|` or the next word and so on...
    * `)` close the second group
    * `/` match for a slash
    * `[` open a character class, which matches all mentioned chars
        * `a-z` all chars from a to z
        * `-` and the minus sign
    * `]` close the character class and match it...
    * `+` ...more than once...
    * `?` ...but as less as possible. This is called non-greediness and is the reason why we have to use the extended regex dialect.
* `)` close the first group
* `\b` look for the end of the word

This defines how a MIME-type looks like. The resulting list should only consist of all the well-formed MIME-types found in your mail. All you have to do is to complement the entries with their corresponding applications as in
```
application/pdf; evince %s;
```
